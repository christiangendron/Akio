# Installation Guide for the Application

Experience our app by following these easy installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**  
   After cloning, navigate to the repository's directory and find the `.env` file. This file is where you need to set your environment variables. We've provided an example file to guide you in setting up these variables correctly.

3. **Get Your Reddit Client ID:**  
   For our app to function optimally, you'll need a Reddit client ID. If you don't have one already, you can obtain one by visiting [Reddit's application preferences page](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). Follow the instructions there to get your Reddit client ID.

4. **Install Expo on Your Phone:**  
   This application is built with Expo, a framework for developing universal React applications. If you don't have Expo installed on your phone, you can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) if you're an iOS user, or from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) if you're an Android user.

5. **Install the Dependencies and Start the App:**  
   Once you've set up the environment variables and installed Expo on your phone, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. After the installation is complete, execute `npm start` to run the application.
