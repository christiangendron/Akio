# Akio

Our Reddit client application is designed with a focus on privacy and simplicity. Unlike the official version, which can feel cluttered with unnecessary features, our app prioritizes content by streamlining the user interface and minimizing distractions. With our app, you can browse Reddit with peace of mind, knowing that your privacy is protected. Whether you're a casual user or a dedicated Redditor, our app is the perfect way to stay up-to-date with the latest discussions, without sacrificing simplicity or privacy.

# Why

As a Reddit user, I noticed that the official app had too many features, which made it cluttered and overwhelming. So, I decided to develop my own Reddit client app with a focus on simplicity and privacy. I wanted to make something that would not only solve a real-world problem, but also help me enhance my skills in React. By creating this app, I'm gaining valuable experience and knowledge in mobile application development.

# Contribution ?

Although I mostly wanted this Reddit client to be a solo project, I am open to the possibility of contributions from others. If you see something wrong with the application or have suggestions on a specific feature, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always looking for ways to improve the app.
